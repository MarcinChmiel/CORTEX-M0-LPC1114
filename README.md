Hello everyone :)

I'd like to introduce to You how to program Cortex M0: LPC1114 microprocessor. I won't use any functions here, I will work with Datasheet using microprocessor registers. All examples in this repository will be written using embedded C language.

I'll focus on how-to-set LPC1114 features like

IO configuration
Timers
ADC
USART
and so on...
